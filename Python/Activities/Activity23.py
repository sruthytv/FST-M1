"""Activity 23

Using pytest:

Create a new test file and do the following:

Create a fixture that initializes a list containing numbers from 0-10.
Write a test method asserting that the sum of that list is 55
Once you confirm that the test passes, move the fixture into the conftest.py file and rerun the test."""
